# kodeWeave
The kodeWeave editor, unlike kodeWeave touch. It incorporates the use of multiple files, has live preview integrated with them, and can load all your favorite libraries by simply checking a box.

You can head to kodeWeave Touch's [public repository](https://github.com/mikethedj4/kodeWeave-Touch/) if you're looking for a mobile/touch friendly IDE.
